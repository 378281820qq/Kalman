Now the car has to determine, where it is in the tunnel. The only information it has, is the velocity in driving direction. The x and y component of the velocity (x˙ and y˙) can be calculated from the absolute velocity (revolutions of the wheels) and the heading of the vehicle (yaw rate sensor).\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Kalman-Filter-CV.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\n## Kalman Filter with Constant Acceleration Model\r\n\r\nSituation covered: You have an acceleration sensor (in 2D: x¨ and y¨) and try to calculate velocity (x˙ and y˙) as well as position (x and y) of a person holding a smartphone in his/her hand.\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Kalman-Filter-CA.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\nSecond example is the same dynamic model but this time you measure the position as well as the acceleration. Both values have to be fused together with the Kalman Filter.\r\nSituation covered: You have an acceleration sensor (in 2D: x¨ and y¨) and a Position Sensor (e.g. GPS) and try to calculate velocity (x˙ and y˙) as well as position (x and y) of a person holding a smartphone in his/her hand.\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Kalman-Filter-CA-2.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\n## Adaptive Kalman Filter with Constant Velocity Model\r\n\r\nHere the Measurement Covariance Matrix R is calculated dynamically via the maximum likelihood of the acutal standard deviation of the last measurements.\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Adaptive-Kalman-Filter-CV.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\n# Extended Kalman Filter\r\n\r\n![EKF Filter Step](https://raw.github.com/balzer82/Kalman/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter-Step.png)\r\n\r\n## Extended Kalman Filter with Constant Turn Rate and Velocity (CTRV) Model\r\n\r\nSituation covered: You have an velocity sensor which measures the vehicle speed (v) in heading direction (ψ) and a yaw rate sensor (ψ˙) which both have to fused with the position (x & y) from a GPS sensor.\r\n\r\n![CTRV Model](https://raw.github.com/balzer82/Kalman/master/CTRV-Model.png)\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter-CTRV.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\n## Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter with Constant Turn Rate and Velocity (CTRV) Model\r\n\r\nSituation covered: You have an velocity sensor which measures the vehicle speed (v) in heading direction (ψ) and a yaw rate sensor (ψ˙) which both have to fused with the position (x & y) from a GPS sensor.\r\n\r\nBecause of poor GPS signal quality, the position measurement is pretty inaccurate. Especially, when the car is standing still, the position error is high. Therefore, an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter is used here. It calculates the measurement noise covariance `R` in every filterstep depending on the `speed` and `EPE` (Estimated Position Error from GPS).\r\n\r\n![Adaptively calculated R](https://raw.github.com/balzer82/Kalman/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter-CTRV-Adaptive-R.png)\r\n\r\nThe trajectory is exportet to a [.kmz](https://github.com/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter-CTRV-Adaptive.kmz?raw=true), which can best viewed with Google Earth.\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter-CTRV-Adaptive.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\n## Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter with Constant Turn Rate and Velocity (CTRV) Model and Attitude Estimation\r\n\r\n![State](https://raw.github.com/balzer82/Kalman/master/Formulas/A-CTRV-Attitude.png)\r\n\r\nRoll and pitch are estimated as well.\r\n\r\n####[View IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/balzer82/Kalman/blob/master/Extended-Kalman-Filter-CTRV-Attitude.ipynb?create=1)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-46744695-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
